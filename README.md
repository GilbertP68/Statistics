This repository hosts code for the exercises that go along with the lessons on statistical analysis
for Data School FOCUS. These exercises should be completed with reference to the course notes, which
provide more detail on the theoretical considerations behind these techniques.

Each exercise is in a separate R Markdown document, but the code is often incomplete, and will need 
several blanks (????? or _____) filled in before it will knit without error.
